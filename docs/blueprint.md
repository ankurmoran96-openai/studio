## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Deep black (#000000) to set a dark and high-end tone, reflecting The Weeknd aesthetic.
- Primary: Neon pink (#FF69B4), vibrant and bold, drawing inspiration from neon elements in The Weeknd's visual style.
- Accent: Purple (#A020F0), analogous to neon pink but with different brightness and saturation, used for interactive elements, highlights, and button glows.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (geometric sans-serif) for headlines and shorter texts, offering a modern and clean look. 'Inter' (grotesque sans-serif) for the body text (Nepali message), ensuring readability.  Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for spacing, sizing, and positioning to create a clean and modern layout. Focus on centering elements and providing ample whitespace.
- Subtle transitions on hover for buttons (using cursor-pointer, transition-all, and duration-300). Implement animated flickering effect for the CSS-drawn candles.
- Draw the heart, cake and candle graphics entirely using CSS shapes and Tailwind CSS classes to avoid emojis
